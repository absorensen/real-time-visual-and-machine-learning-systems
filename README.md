.

## Recommended Prerequisites
One or more of the following:  
[High Performance Computing](https://kurser.dtu.dk/course/2023-2024/02614)  
[Compute Graphics](https://kurser.dtu.dk/course/02561)  
[Computer Vision](https://kurser.dtu.dk/course/2023-2024/02504)  
[Deep Learning](https://kurser.dtu.dk/course/02456)  
[Advanced Deep Learning in Computer Vision](https://kurser.dtu.dk/course/2023-2024/02501)  

## Target Audience

M.Sc. students with an interest in systems programming, especially if they are
interested in deep learning, computer graphics, computer vision, image analysis or signal processing.

PhD students who need to learn about performance and real-time systems. If they don't have previous
experience in C++ or Rust they may benefit from spending some time preparing by reading
[module 0](https://absorensen.github.io/the-guide/m0_introduction/) and the material
from [Rust itself](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn).

## Learning Objectives

A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:

* Program using the Rust language and the WGPU API.
* Describe how computational graphs work.
* Describe how virtualized memory hierarchies work.
* Describe how a GPU works and how it fits in the memory hierarchy.
* Describe basic concepts in smart pointers, graph representations and garbage collectors.
* Give an overview of core concepts in concurrency.
* Explain input events and event-based processing.
* Explain integers and bitwise operations as well as floats and precision.
* Perform performance profiling and optimization of complex heterogeneous systems.
* Analyze cases relevant to the students' specialization.
* Choose the right tools presented in the course for implementing their own project.
* Programming, presenting and analyzing the students' own real-time system.

## Evaluation
All work must be done alone, but it is recommended to talk about the problems.

* Coding - Memory hierarchies and GPU's
* Analysis - Analysing a code template and minimum 3 points from a list of articles
* Programming project - presentating a functoning real-time system and hand-in of the product and a log book of
the development process

### Course work
Aside from reading and listening:  

* Rudimentary Rust exercises - Advent of Code and Ray Tracing in One Weekend
* Paper and pen exercises about memory
* Types coding exercises
* Setup one or more profilers and explore them
* Analysis, presentation and discussion exercise. Choose a use case, analyze it, present it in groups and discuss

## Schedule
Location: Building 321, room 232 at DTU  
The lectures before New Years will be from 13-17  
The project work after New Years will be all day, but you can come and go as you'd like
The course ends with a demo day where you can show off your hard work
