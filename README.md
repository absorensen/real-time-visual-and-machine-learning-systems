## Recommended Prerequisites
[High Performance Computing](https://kurser.dtu.dk/course/2023-2024/02614)  
[Compute Graphics](https://kurser.dtu.dk/course/02561) and/or  
[Computer Vision](https://kurser.dtu.dk/course/2023-2024/02504) and/or  
[Deep Learning](https://kurser.dtu.dk/course/02456) and/or  
[Advanced Deep Learning in Computer Vision](https://kurser.dtu.dk/course/2023-2024/02501)

## Target Audience

M.Sc. students with an interest in systems programming, especially if they are
interested in deep learning, computer graphics, computer vision, image analysis or signal processing.

PhD students who need to learn about performance and real-time systems. If they don't have previous
experience in C++ or Rust they might need to spend some time preparing.

## Learning Objectives

A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:

* Program using the Rust language and the WGPU API.
* Describe how computational graphs work.
* Describe how virtualized memory hierarchies work.
* Describe how a GPU works and how it fits in the memory hierarchy.
* Describe basic concepts in smart pointers, graph representations and garbage collectors.
* Give an overview of core concepts in concurrency.
* Explain input events and event-based processing.
* Explain integers and bitwise operations as well as floats and precision.
* Perform performance profiling and optimization of complex heterogeneous systems.
* Analyze cases relevant to the students' specialization.
* Choose the right tools presented in the course for implementing their own project.
* Programming, presenting and analyzing the students' own real-time system.

## Evaluation
All work must be done alone, but it is recommended to talk with other students and the teacher.

* 2 Hand-ins
* Presentation on Demo Day of a real-time system
* Final report on the design, process and implementation of the real-time system

### Course work
Aside from reading and listening:  

* Rudimentary Rust exercises
* Paper and pen exercise
* HAND-IN - Coding - memory hierarchies and GPU's
* HAND-IN - Analysis - Analysing a code template and minimum 3 points from a list of articles
* Inference exercise
* Analysis/presentation/discussion exercise. The student will choose a use case,
analyze it, present it to a group and then discuss it  
* Try a profiler with a use case
* HAND-IN & DEMO - Significant programming project - presentation on demo day
and report hand-in about the product and the process

## Schedule
